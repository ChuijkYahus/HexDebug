# HexDebug

Hex Casting addon that runs a local debug server using DAP.

## TODOs

* Restart should actually restart the hex.
* Indentation doesn't work with Consideration for some reason.
* Move the open port to the client side and forward requests/responses/events via packets.
* Don't start the server until the debugger item is actually used.
