# HexDebug

Hex Casting addon that runs a local debug server using DAP.

## TODOs

* Don't start the server until the debugger item is actually used? (possibly problematic)
* Wait a bit after terminating to handle any late requests instead of immediately going back to NotDebugging.
* Flipping offhand spellbook pages should be prioritized over changing main hand debugger modes.
* Display mishaps, and possibly allow pausing at them like exceptions.
