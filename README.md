# HexDebug

Hex Casting addon that runs a local debug server using DAP.

All textures are made by [SamsTheNerd](https://modrinth.com/user/SamsTheNerd)!

## TODOs

* Allow debug client to fetch sources after termination (ie. for exceptions).
* Add a cool sound effect!
* Implement the Splicing Table.
* Add configs:
  * Disable opening local port
  * Disable smart shift-scroll for debugger when not debugging
