# HexDebug

Hex Casting addon that runs a local debug server using DAP.

All textures are made by [SamsTheNerd](https://modrinth.com/user/SamsTheNerd)!

## TODOs

* Allow debug client to fetch sources after termination (ie. for exceptions).
* Hide step mode icon in creative mode tab.
* Add a cool sound effect!
* Implement the Splicing Table.
